How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs in small pieces and test each piece.  I then incorporate these pieces into larger pieces of code.  This allows me to keep the code maintainable, readable, and adaptable.  The advantages were that the course takes you through the agile method.  You develop each piece at a time, starting from the bottom.  I could use this CRUD Python module in the future by continuing to develop the module to be maintainable, readable, and adaptable.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Most Information Professionals make small changes and evaluate the result of those changes.  As a computer scientist, I approach problems the same way.  This course differed from other courses as I had to develop code on several different layers that then worked together to provide a solution to the customer.  Other courses generally have you work on one level.  The technique and strategy that I will use in the future is the agile method.  Start from the bottom and work my way towards the end user interface.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists research ways to better the human condition through the power of computing.  It matters so that our daily lives because easier and we can use the power of data to make choices to keep our lives and society moving in a healthy direction.  My work will help Grazioso Salvare to achieve their goals for their customers and the animals they protect and manage.
